Smart AI Cane uses a camera, sensors, and MemryX Edge AI to help visually impaired users navigate safely. It detects obstacles, stairs, doors, and vehicles, measures their distance, and provides voice or vibration alerts. The camera also recognizes traffic lights, informing the user when itâ€™s red or green for safe crossing.
