Cano is a Smart AI Cane powered by MemryX Edge AI, designed to help visually impaired users navigate safely and independently.
Currently, Cano uses a built-in camera and AI models to detect obstacles, stairs, doors, and vehicles, and to recognize traffic lights, identifying whether they are red or green for safe crossing.
In future development, Cano will integrate sensors for enhanced spatial awareness and provide vibration or audio feedback to guide users in real time.
